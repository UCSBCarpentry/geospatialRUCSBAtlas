# geospatialRUCSBAtlas
A repo to keep track of a set of examples for an R for GeoSpatial workshop.

Scripts run parallel to the episodes of Raster and Vector Data with R Data Carpentry

Folder `source_data` is *.* git ignored. Data files are in our Google Drive, or downloaded in the episode scripts. To start,
have these datasets in source_data:

- Campus_Buildings
- NCOS_Shorebird_Foraging_Habitat
- Coal_Oil_Sign_Inventory       
- NCOS_Bird_Observations_20190619_web
- greatercampusDEM

Next, run the data_prep.r script. From there, each episode
script will load libraries and re-create any objects
needed for the lesson.
