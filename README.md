# geospatialRUCSBAtlas
A repo to keep track of a set of examples for an R for GeoSpatial workshop.

Scripts run parallel to the episodes of Raster and Vector Data with R Data Carpentry.


Make sure to set up your project with a `source_data` folder,
and copy over ALL of the data in our google drive:
Carpentry/Workshop Development/Local Data for Workshops/geo.

`source_data` is *.* git ignored, so it's probably not going to
get made automatically.

To start, run data_prep.r

Next, run the data_prep.r script. From there, each episode
script will load libraries and re-create any objects
needed for the lesson.
