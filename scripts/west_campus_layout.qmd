## NCOS Open Space Transformation

Between 2018 and 2023, UCSB's CCBER transformed a dis-used golf course into a set of rare California coastal habitats.

## Prepare our graphics

```{r}
library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
```

Make the objects:

```{r}
before <- rast("../source_data/SkySatCollect/20161210_185631_ssc3_u0001_pansharpened_clip.tif")

before
```

```{r}
# get a comparison image. One we made earlier
after <- rast("../source_data/SkySatCollect/20220627_214052_ssc7_u0001_pansharpened_clip.tif")
after
```

```{r}
# it didn't come with the values calculated, so this takes care of that
# it won't plot without it.
setMinMax(after)
```

Both are EPSG: 32611, so they would overlay. But we want a side-by-side:

```{r}
after
```

```{r}
# make dataframes
before_df <- as.data.frame(before, xy = TRUE)
after_df <- as.data.frame(after, xy = TRUE)

str(before_df)

```

```{r}
plotRGB(before, scale=1932, stretch="lin")
```

```{r}
plotRGB(after, scale=6385, stretch="lin")
label2022 <- "2022 Image"
text(after)
```
