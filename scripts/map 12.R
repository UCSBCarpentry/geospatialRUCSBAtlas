# map 12
# let's build monthly NDVI's for campus
# as in episode 12 

# loop over the files and build a raster stack

# calculate the NDVIs

# display the grid of NDVIs

# make bins

# display the binned histograms of the NDVIs

# Julian dates: that's in the lesson, but ours uses calendar dates
# challenge: change object names to Julian dates

# What month was the Greenest?

# we'll need weather data

# when was it rainiest?
