# Convert from .csv to a Vector Layer

# we will also use a json aoi as we use that elsewhere.

library(sf)
library(terra)

# Import .csv

# Identify x,y, columns
# head()

# .csv to sf object

# st_as_sf() 



# Plot Spatial Object

# Plot Extent
# AOI plus points

# use a geojson aoi


# Challenge: import & plot more points

# Export to an Esri shapefile


# ends with st_write out to a point shapefile.
# from this point on, maybe we should depend more on 
# the output data folder.
