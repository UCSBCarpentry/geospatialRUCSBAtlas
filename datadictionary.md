# Data Files needed
Before we can integrate the files into the lesson scripts,
we need to know where we are going. Therefore, we need to build
the finished maps. 

This is a list of all the data required for the 7 maps 
described on the [Read Me](https://github.com/UCSBCarpentry/geospatialRUCSBAtlas/blob/main/README.md)

* Hillshades at 3 scales and extents:
  * The Bite of California
  * Campus context: campus_topo_bath
  * Henley Gate to Ellwood Beach: campus_topo_bath
  * we will need 3 tiffs out of data_prep.r for these
* Shapefiles
  * Walkways
  * Buildings
  * Trees
* Vernal pools
  * will be created by analysis in a script.
