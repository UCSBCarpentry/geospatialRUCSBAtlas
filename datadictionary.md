# Data Files needed
Before we can integrate the files into the lesson scripts,
we need to know where we are going. Therefore, we need to build
the finished maps. 

This is a list of all the data required for the 7 maps 
described on the [Read Me](https://github.com/UCSBCarpentry/geospatialRUCSBAtlas/blob/main/README.md)

* Hillshades at 3 scales and extents:
Which episodes do each of these come in?
What is their original source and format/CRS?
  * The Bite of California
  * Campus context: campus_topo_bath
  * Henley Gate to Ellwood Beach: campus_topo_bath
  * we will need 3 tiffs out of data_prep.r for these
* Shapefiles
  * Walkways
  * Buildings
    * [Carpentry Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SwcCrBoa0a7I_kmBNCa3_zNQ6Aw9P-8H)
  * Trees
  * Bike paths: 
     * There is some confusion about which one.
     * source_data/bike_paths/bike_paths
* Vernal pools
  * will be created by analysis in a script.
